Welcome to Redis 1.2.0

This is a rebranded 1.1.95-beta, also known as 1.2.0 release candidate 6
because no critical bug was found in the latest weeks.

Redis 1.0 users are urged to upgrade as this release is backward compatibile
with 1.0 (there are a few changes in some commands, but the new behavior is
saner and you should notice it unless you are abusing the API really hard).
